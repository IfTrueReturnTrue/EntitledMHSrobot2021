2. Our current kit + updates about new materials
3. Proper issue format

## To fellow collaborators:
Whenever you would like to make a change, please make sure to use** pull requests**. I will look over the code and see if it is good. It it is, I will add it to the main branch.
_Note that Although you can directly merge into the main branch, I want to review the code first, so please use the pull request method._
## Our current kit:
So basically here's the  kit we have:
- 4 large motors
- 2 medium motors 
- More medium motors are to come soon (this will enable omni wheel movement)
- Omni wheels in around two weeks time
- 2 ultra sonic sensors
- 2 colour sensors
- 2 infrared sensors
- 2 compass sensors

## How to create an issue (proper format):
Whenever you want to create an issue do this:
1. Assign the issue the appropriate tag
2. In a main heading section, outline the main issue
3. Potential solutions/suggestions
4. Further commments
5. Assign the issue to the proper people
If any person comments on your issue (a relevant one of course), please ensure to stay active and **actually respond**
